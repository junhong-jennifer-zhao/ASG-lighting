# ASG-lighting
This is the code for extract the parameters for Anistropic Spherical Guassian parametric model to represent the environment lighting. 

# Key Parameters:
	GAUSS_SPHERE_SX 				= [0,1] # This is SG
	GAUSS_SPHERE_SX_SY 				= [1,2] # This is ASG
	GAUSS_SPHERE_SX_SY_T 			= [2,3] # This is ASG with rotation
